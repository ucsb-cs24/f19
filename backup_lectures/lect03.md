# Topics

## The big four
* Constructor 
 	- Default and parameterized constructors (Review)
	- Initializing const member variables using initialization lists
* Destructor
* Copy-constructor
* Copy-assignment

## Non member functions and friend functions
* If a non-member function is declared to be a friend of a class, it can access the private members of the class.
* Discuss when/why you might use friend functions


## Makefiles
* We will split our implementation of the die Game from the previous class into three files  - header file (contains only the class definition), source file (contains the implementation of the class methods - no main), test file - uses the ADT. (More practice on this in lab02)
* Write a simple Makefile to compile all the different programs written in class
