# Topics



## Lesson plan
* Revisit the big four for linked list: C++ provides a default constructor, destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator for any class that doesn't have one explicitly defined.
* More on operator overloading
	- ==, !=, << 
	
* Use cases for friend functions
* Review C++ memory management and using valgrind
* Debugging with GDB
